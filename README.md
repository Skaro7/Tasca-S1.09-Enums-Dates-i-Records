# Enums, Dates & Records – Modern Java Features (Level 1)

## 📄 Description

This task introduces three fundamental Java topics that help you write **clearer, safer, and more modern code**:

* **Enums** – to represent finite and controlled sets of values  
* **Java Time API** – to work with dates and times in a robust way  
* **Records** – a modern Java feature for declaring immutable data classes with less boilerplate  

In this level, the focus is on **Enums**, learning how to define them, use them in conditions and classes, and extract useful information from them.

The goal is to understand how enums improve:

* Type safety  
* Readability  
* Maintainability  
* Encapsulation of behavior
